Version 2024-05-16:
  Config: Cmd to turn en/dis telling PC to shut off while doing calibration,               
  en/dis for normal UPS Emulation mode. With PC reporting disabled, also set the capacities
  to 100% so that the PC queries return good capacities and dont put PCs to sleep.         
  Print calculated capacities, but do NOT update what gets sent to the PC/NAS              
  while in config mode (let us verify calc's w/o PC shutdown).                             
  Default: Config mode: Disabled, Normal Run mode: Enabled.                                
                                                                                           
  At factory: 1st load EEPROM with compiled values. Then may adjust and save               
  A/D Voltage calibration and  tweeked curves to EEPROM with unpublished command ("ZSF")   
  User request of Load Factory Settings gets values from this part of EEPROM.              
                                                                                           
  Voltage to Capacity calculations:                                                        
      4 voltage&Capacity points to better match voltage curves                             
      One default set for each battery type                                                

Version 2024-05-10:
  Previously removed sprintf's, that freed some Prog memory.
  Added capacity tables for different battery chemistries. Prog mem: 93%
  Removed one "float", that freed up 1k of prog mem! Now 89% used.

Previous:
  Removed calls to sprintf(). Save over 1k of flash.  Fixed print in PluggableUSB_::plug.
  With SERIAL1_IRQ_DEBUG=true, Flash=25962 (2710 free), Available Memory: 851.
  (numbers before adding in more USBDebug prints for checking startup execution.

Prior Version:
  Fixed unexplained PC shutdown. (Win10 driver bug?)
  It appears that the Win10 UPS driver will occasionally sent whatever 
  the present HID_PD_REMAININGCAPACITY is to the HID_PD_REMNCAPACITYLIMIT; sending it 
  to the Leonardo. We now report when that problem happens, but ignore the setting.
  Also moved many strings (for printouts) to flash: F(""), freeing up RAM.
  Added projected.h which now holds SERIAL1_DEBUG and related.
  
  I tested with Ubuntu on a laptop, and in CDC Enabled mode, it did not show up,
  but in CDC Disabled mode it did show up. Ubuntu never seemed to send the
  HID_PD_REMNCAPACITYLIMIT setting to the Leo (yay), but my debug prints indicate
  that the Leo is not successfully sending the PowerDevice.sendReport's.
  These printed out to Serial1:
       Sending: Batt Remaining = 88%, 105:36, Discharging: N, Status = 0x8
       Comms with PC (neg=bad): -1,-1
  Ubuntu continued to show the initial Leo "battery" capacity, and it never 
  updated. On Win10 it did eventually update.
