See README.txt for more information about SerialTerminal.

The SerialTerminal.exe file is in the subfolder dist\SerialTerminal.
Execute SerialTerminal.exe from there. The "_internal" folder must be 
present there too.

This folder contains the Python script SerialTerminal.py.
It may be executed from here if you have the Python environment installed 
along with the necessary libraries. If you make enhancements/changes to 
it, you may recompile it using the CompilePY.bat file. That batch file 
will also copy SerialTerminal.py and the README.txt file to 
dist\SerialTerminal. These files are just for reference, and are not 
needed there.
